              I have a passion for exploring and developing innovative ideas. As
              a naturally curious person, I became interested in coding by
              wondering on how I could hack into my neighbors' Wi-Fi. Although
              this wasn't a part of my formal education in Computer Science, I
              found turning designs into functional websites and applications
              very fulfilling and enjoyable, which ultimately led me to pursue
              programming as a career.

              Today, as a full-time software developer with a specialization in
              mobile development, I have extensive experience working with

              in web development and have a broad range of skills that extend
              beyond just mobile development.
