              I have a passion for exploring and developing innovative ideas. As
              a naturally curious person, I became interested in coding by
              wondering on how I could hack into my neighbors' Wi-Fi. Although
              this wasn't a part of my formal education in Computer Science, I
              found turning designs into functional websites and applications
              very fulfilling and enjoyable, which ultimately led me to pursue
              programming as a career.

              beyond just mobile development.
